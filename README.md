A chore todo list that will make your home awesome!

Designed by the lovely Emily Pearce and developed by [David Langford] (https://github.com/That-David-Guy).

## Purpose

1. To help you keep your house clean
2. Refresh my AngularJS skills


## Install

* `npm install`

## Development

1. `npm run dev`
2. Go to [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/)

The javascript files run through [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) so feel free to use the latest [JS6/ECMA2015](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/New_in_JavaScript/ECMAScript_6_support_in_Mozilla) goodness.

## Scripts

* `npm run build` - generate a minified build to dist folder
* `npm run dev` - start development server, `http://localhost:8080/`
* `npm run test` - run all tests
* `npm run test:live` - continuously run unit tests watching for changes

## Technology used

1. AngularJS (v1 not 2)
2. Webpack
3. Babel
